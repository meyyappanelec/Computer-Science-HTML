  <p style="font-size:120%;font-family:cursive">After Kulothunga Chozha, the later kings tried to keep the Chozha Dynasty stable but failed. The Chozha dynasty suffered
and came to a downfall at the end of the 13th century. The Cholas were replaced by Pandyas and the Hoysalas in the south, and of the later Chalukyas by the Yadavas and the Kakatiyas. Though the Chozha Dynasty
fell their architectural monuments and great rule would never fade from history. This is a table is the list of imperial Chozha Rulers:</p>
